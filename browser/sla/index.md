## Starboard X SLA (Software License Agreement)

**X Data**
Starboard X ships with a feature called X Data, which will (by default) opt-in to sending anylitcs to Starboard Operations.
X Data can be disabled via your Starboard account. You can request your X Data to be deleted by opening a discussion on the main Desktop
page.

**Downloading installer files**
Starboard 1.4.9 and up have installers hosted on Github releases. When downloading a release, Microsoft may recieve some of your data such
as IP, OS version, or something else.

Microsoft is an official, trusted vendor for Starboard. Let's be honest, it's more safe here then anywhere else ;)

**Agreement to the SLA**
As listed in Starboard X and above, by downloading, you agree to the SLA. You may choose not to read it, but then you might want to opt-out. Then you can't, because
you didn't read this.
